Nutpie is part of the PyMC organization, a collection of open source
probabilistic programming projects. The PyMC organization develops and maintains
tools for Bayesian statistical modeling and probabilistic machine learning.

Nutpie provides a high-performance implementation of the No-U-Turn Sampler
(NUTS) that can be used with models defined in PyMC, Stan and other frameworks.
It was created to enable faster and more efficient Bayesian inference while
maintaining compatibility with existing probabilistic programming tools.
